Sometime ago I wrote "[4 JS projects at Github for your web app.][1]" soon after I felt sorry about all the ones I did not write about. So here comes another four JavaScript projects.

### mustache.js

"Logic-less {{mustache}} templates with JavaScript", I have not been using mustache.js for a long time but I can see tons of use for it in the future. It allows you to use its variables declared in JS or JSON almost anywhere with its simple syntax. I won't go into explaining it, I leave that to it's documentation. 
I found mustache.js through my contributions to [Adobe Brackets][2], there it's used for translations. I will probably use it similarly in some apps I working on, not major translations such as docs but UI related stuff.

### favico.js

favico.js allows you to do tons of things with your web pages favicon, add animated badges, use any image as favicon or a video and some other stuff. It's supported in Opera, Chrome and Firefox.  
I don't know if I will ever use this project in any public application, but it's fun to play around with!

### jQuery Hotkeys

Yep, a jQuery plugin. It's a great one, I first used it in a early version of [Board][6]. Since [App Ground 1.3][7] jQuery Hotkeys is included there.
If you have worked with adding hotkeys in a web app, you know that isn't a fun story. Using jQuery Hotkeys it becomes a easy task, it's developed by John Resig mostly known for developing jQuery ;-)

### Imager.js

The `<picture>` element haven't seen the daylight yet, hopefully we will see it in Firefox Aurora soon. Imager.js is developed at BBC News and is a great solution for responsive images. No more loading of multiply images. In favor of other solutions Imager.js can deal with pixel density, not something always needed but sill useful sometimes. I leave the exploration to you :-)
