I haven't worked on any open source projects during this day, but I have learned a lot…

Sometimes when I’m learning something new I can work on something for hours and still I get nowhere. I just keep “googling”(“DuckDuckGoing”) and checking for solutions at Stackoverflow… Some hours was like that today, but after just one successful thing it all changed now after even more hours I have done a lots of work on my new training log. PHP maybe isn't my favorite language yet but I think PHP and I now can be friends.

I should maybe post a “weekly update” on Sundays in the future?
Now it’s time for German learning, a language that I have been trying to learn for years… I wonder what my teacher thinks is inside my brain ;-)
