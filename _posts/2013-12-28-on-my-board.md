I have many projects going on, some open source some not, some active some inactive, but I would like to share them with you. Have your thoughts on them and write about my workflow.

I have always something to achieve when I start a project, most of the time it’s about creating something I will use, App Ground I use all the time, parts of Facile Framework I use in nearly all my projects. But more often it’s about learning something new, at least two off my current ones is about just that. Trying to learn PHP(again, we didn't end up as friends first time) my workflow has changed, before I wrote the tasks on my weekly to do list together with stuff like “English homework” and “cleaning my bike”, I dropped that system for bugs and features…

Now when I started a big backend/frontend project, came up with another list system, It’s based on one thing. I get all the good ideas about features and solutions when I’m away from a computer, so I write it down is some random document on my phone, until now. Now I give every project a folder in Evernote and a note, then I list all bugs and new features by priority. So the first things on the list is bugs, then there are features, and at the bottom on the list there's things that I think ”This I may do this year or the next one” about… Now using this system I ended up having projects with nearly no bugs if any and the projects was finished in the way that I could use them early on. For bigger tasks I create a new note and split it up into smaller tasks.

To the projects then…

App Ground
App Ground is the project I have written most about, it’s not because it’s my biggest one(it’s quite small) it’s because it’s a project that I use and it does not take time from me. It saves time. I will probably release a update tomorrow(damm today it seems like now). Some reports of a 404 request on IE11 when pinning a site in Windows 8.1.

Facile Framework
This has been inactive time to time but still I hopes that I will be available to deliver a stable version. My own CSS framework, not a frontend framework as Bootstrap or Foundation. Did just earlier designed a new grid system that’s will be a bit more flexible than the existing ones.

Abbes Board
This is a project that many of you have seen live, my startpage for web browsing, as the development on version one ended a while ago I’m planning to release it as open source when I have time to do some “code cleaning”. Version one did only had sync if the extension was installed(it was only available of Opera 15+). I have never meant to make Board a stable application, somethings works in only Firefox, some things only in Chrome and so on. It’s just my starting point when I using a web browser. In version two I did some work with the Dropbox datastore API it was still in beta back then. The project died because the API was still buggy and I did lots of mailing to the developers, they fixed the bugs but I felt it wasn't worth it.

*Workout diary*
This got no name yet. This is the big project that changed the way I listed my tasks. From the beginning it was all about replace my old C# workout log and learn more PHP, but now it’s not only logging my workouts it also produces statics from the data and it can handle tons of users. I have also done some work frontend I’m proud of. This isn't open source and it won't be, but parts of it will! I would like to make this app available to some users later on. To learn how to run a service and see what it takes and what I can improve. For now I need to spend my money carefully so look into the feature for this project(and in any case it will only be for swedish users)...

Then of course I have this blog and some other projects. Overall this christmas holidays is going to an end and I will spend the last days of it in southern Sweden with friends...
