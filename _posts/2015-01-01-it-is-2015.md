2014 as a blogging year it did start well, five posts in January and nine in February. Seven of the blog posts wast about my OMap Mapper project([1][1], [2][2], [3][3], [4][4], [5][5], [6][6], [7][7]), I have never been using it. It requires time! in March I was trying to keep the blogging going by the use of weekly updates, it did work, for three weeks([1][8], [2][9], [3][10]). In April I complained about the fact that I had to little time. In May I [published my AWW library][11](AJAX for WebWorkers), I ended up never using WebWorkers. In June I wrote about [my idea][12] to visualize my Long Night leg at Night Hawk in Oslo. In August I wrote about how that idea [went all wrong][13]. I also moved to Nyk&ouml;ping and begun studying orienteering and technology. In October I had a one week holiday so I did blog twice about OpenStreetMap([1][14], [2][15]). And that's 2014 as a blogging year.

2015 is going to be the best year ever, the orienteering season starts the 14th March in Denmark and soon after the Swedish League starts. I have also two ongoing projects that will be going live during this spring. More about them here in the coming days!

Have a great 2015 everyone!
