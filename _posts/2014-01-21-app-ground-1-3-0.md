App Ground just got another major update, this time I have improved everything, based on feedback and testing. I won't cover all of the changes here but you can always check the [changelog][1].

### Dropped Apache config

Your web app needs to be fast so face it Nginx is faster. I know many boilerplates for both Apache and Nginx and adding one of them isn't that hard. App Ground should not cover server related stuff. [In Ubuntu server 14.04 Niginx will be a part of its main repo.][4]

### Updated Normalize.css

No, 2.1.3 is still the latest version. But still Normalize has got several tweaks and changes and it's these I have added.  Yesterday I saw a weird commit over at Github that seams to be Normalize.css 3 Alpha(Compass and Sass?!).

### Dropped help.js in favor of Modernizr

Help.js had its benefits but Modernizr seams to be a common solution. Personally I will use help.js but Modernizr was requested, help.js was only used in App Ground and Modernizr is used in big projects such as HTML5 Boilerplate.

### Dropped the "position" CSS help classes

I use the position classes from Facile often, but most to prototyping in a optimized Web app I would never use them. Now when Facile Framework is moving in the direction to become a prototyping CSS Framework I'm consider dropping all of it in favor of less help classes. In [App Ground 1.2][5] I dropped the print styles.

Some other things: Twitter cards, Hotkeys, bug fixes and some other stuff!

I think that this update is great and that App Ground now is great to!
