I haven't posted anything here, I haven't updated any of my projects and I have been "dead" at Google+/Twitter in a while. I got a reason, or two maybe three but first some things I have done.

**Redesigned this blog**

 - New Background
 - New Color Scheme 
 - WebKit Scrollbar Styling
 - Improved Map On The Landing Page
 - Support For Embeded Maps/YouTube
 
I still need some more creative for the blog header, looking weird right now, I need to replace the social buttons(for speed) and design, the Google+ one is really slow and I need to write some script to make sure that Disqus is only loading when used(speed and the fact that all discussions ends up on Twitter and Google+).


**Updated App Ground**
Not any major changes(no needs for it) but changed to Normalize.css version 3 and there is on "and" ;-)

So I need to have some reasons for nearly none commits to Github in about two weeks?

**School**, boring but interesting, physics is fun, math is also fun, the rest is just boring, I'm quite sure that I have the grades I need but now I end up working to improve them anyway. My old thought "Why work for grades I don't need?" I seams to forgot about.

**Orienteering**, the best thing ever invented is back after a not so long winter, I'm not allowed to run everything I would like to,for example I'm not running in the league for now, but still all the traveling takes time and my weekends will be occupied until next winter ;-)

**My not so secret project**, the thing that takes most time from my open source/data is a web service I'm working on, some people reading this can probably guess what it's all about, when I decides to tell everyone what it's I will explain it and my intentions. It's nothing that doesn't exists, probably it won't be public, because I won't be available to cover the server costs and I have no intends to make any profit. It's all about learning as always ;-)
