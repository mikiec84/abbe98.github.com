Two days ago Unity announced the new version of their multi-platform game engine [Unity 5][1], it feels like it was just some months ago they announced Unity 4.

Unity 5 got tons of new features but the best(from my perspective) is that the games will run in web browser without the Unity plugin, thanks to WebGL and [asm.js][3]. Right now asm.js only works in Firefox but now when both Unreal Engine 4 and Unity 5 will use it in their engines, will probably Chrome and IE support it too by the end of the year.

In the trailer Unity and Mozilla showoff the popular game Dead trigger.
