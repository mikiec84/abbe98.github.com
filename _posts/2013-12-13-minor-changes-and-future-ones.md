So this webpage was a 30 minutes hack + some hours of bug fixes, for short I have a long list of “Todo”s…
But I have been doing two very small improvements…

 - Wrapped all of the posts inside a article element and not just in a div.
 - Added Google Analytics

Nearly everything that I want to change or add, can I fix quite fast… But…

This isn’t on my priority list, because I will probably rewrite the entire site during my christmas holidays(starting in a week)...

Here is a list of those small things I would like to fix/add…

 - About me page.
 - New color scheme.
 - Sidebar to display other posts.
 - Social links somewhere.
 - Images in posts.
 - Custom OGP image for posts.
 - Project page(not just the old page as I do provide for now).
 - Share posts from startpage.
 - Tags.
 - New menu and footer.
 - Fix post header on mobile.
...

You got it?

Noway I will do that stuff if I’m planning to rewrite the site…

More about the “new site” in the coming week…

And I decided that I will release App Ground 1.1.2 before I publish the docs, so 1.1.2 later this week and the docs somewhere around christmas…
