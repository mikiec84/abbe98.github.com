Last week I took a day to do a bit of open source maintenance, fixing bugs, writing documentation, tests etc and definitive no new features.

One of the things I did was to write documentation for my [K-Sams&ouml;k](4) Python library KSamsok-PY.  It's a port of [KSamsok-PHP](1) which I have written a lot about. Nowadays I have a local setup of kulturarvsdata.se (the repository behind K-Sams&ouml;k), so the libraries is mainly used in production and to maintain my local instance. KSasmok-PY is actually powering [Kyrks&ouml;k](3).

`pip install ksamsok` and head over to the [documentation](2).
