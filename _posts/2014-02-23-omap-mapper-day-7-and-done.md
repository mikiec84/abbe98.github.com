Since some hours back OMap Mapper is published at [Github][1], some hours of coding and 44 commits. 50% PHP, 20% JavaScript and 30% CSS, Github got the commits [graphs][2] for those who is interested. 

If you would like to download and install it, you should note that you will probably need to change `upload_max_filesize` in `php.ini` and that I filed in some issues in the [bug tracker][3]. 

Before I can recommend this to non developers I will need to add [delete][4]/[edit][5] support and [exporting/embedding][6] to the list of features. By the time I will also write a installation guide for non-developers and publish it here at my blog and on the [OMap Mapper wiki][7]. Hopefully orienteers will start contributing to the [Open Street Map][8] project too.

Third-party projects that the project uses includes:

**[Leaflet][9]**
JavaScript library for interactive maps the best map library you can work with!

**[Leaflet Markercluster][10]**
A Leaflet plugin for dealing with marker clusters, nice animations and easy to customize.

**[Open Street Map][8]**
Provides the best map data on the web, and is one of the largest open data projects in the world.

**[IcoMoon Icons][11]**
Great and nice looking icon font.

All the blog posts about OMap Mapper:

 - [OMap Mapper a project during the holidays][12]
 - [OMap Mapper day one][13]
 - [OMap Mapper day two][14]
 - [OMap Mapper day three][15]
 - [OMap Mapper day four][16]
 - [OMap Mapper day five][17]

That's it, had a great time creating this and hopefully it will continue to be improved over time. This project will result in more future blog posts and other stuff.
