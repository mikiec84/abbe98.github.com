I'm just about to order a [Forerunner 210][1] GPS watch because I have lost my best running watch and I'm in need of one for the orienteering. 
In august I'm going to Holmenkollen in Norway to participate in the orienteering relay [Night Hawk][2] and last year the Norwegian government decided to release tons of Geo data under CC BY 3.0 ,this data includes height data(DMT) for a major part of Norway ([Source][3] (in Norwegian)).

I think you know where I'm heading!

Just think about the amazing visualization I will be available to render! First the DMT rendered with WebGl in 3D, then the orienteering map as a layer on top of that and then the GPS track on top of that(Probably I need to write some custom GeoJSON solution) with the possibility to watch my lap! I can find some "How to write" issues in my idea right now but I leave them for later.

To make it even more cool I will try to lend a GoPro Hero so I can sync a video from the forest with the 3D map(The Headlight is a issue there but it's a small issue).

Get it, It's the best most awesome idea in the history of ice cream!
